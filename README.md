Liferay Address Validator
=========================

The Address validator plugin enables the validation of addresses entered by the user.

It uses some third party services or APIs for that purpose. The initial implementation uses Google Geocoding API, 
but it can be extended to use different APIs.

See all the documentation in this [wiki](http://wiki.rivetlogic.com/display/LRA/Address+validator).
